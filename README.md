opration system project
this is my first project in github and I did my best to 
make it as good as possible. I have a cpp file "operating system project" which contains my source code which can run on linux environment.
you should have an input file and also an output file. An example of the command line which will run the program is "./cmpe351 -f input.txt -o output.txt". 
I spend 3 weeks to complete this project.I did all of the 8 functions for cpu scheduling simulator.
but for example,the content of fcfspreemptive, which does not support preemptive mode, is same as fcfsnonpreemptive 
so it shows the result for the nonpreemptive,same as round robin.
